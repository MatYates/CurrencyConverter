# CurrencyConverter
Currency converter coding test


Although the design looks like it converts australian dollers to other currencies, that is a paid feature for fixer.io so i used euro as the base as that is the free tier.


The coding choice i made was to go for a MVVM (or my interpretation of it anyway), I like that it keeps thing seperate, and makes it easier to test things.

If I had more time I would of made the custom component to select the currency to convert to more reusable, but I found myself running out of time and needed to get other things done.

Alos the api would usually be setup differently and have a more complicated layer of maybe saving to a database depending on the project, but i kept it simple as the brief states.

i used no libraries in theis example, but if it was a bigger project i would likly use a networking library, a library for the databse etc.
